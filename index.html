        <p>At the end of the day, it is good to reflect on what happened for you, and your team mates. Taking a few
            minutes to share how it was for you, and to listen how it was for the others really matters.</p>
        <p>The principle is simple: you roll a random retrospective format, and let everyone share about this.</p>
